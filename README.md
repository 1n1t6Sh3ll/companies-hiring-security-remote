# companies-hiring-security-remote
This repo is meant to be a list of companies that hire security people full remote.

# Motivation

According to multiple articles (e.g. https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/08/09/the-cybersecurity-talent-gap-is-an-industry-crisis/#13bec3c0a6b3 ) there is a huge gap of security talent, one reason being the shortage of remote welcome positions. The more talent gap there is, the more the talented people can choose positions, so promoting remote friendly positions / teams is a way to attract people.

# Contributing
You can help that list by creating issues or creating merge requests.

# Quality Gate

Some companies promote remote talents, some other don't but are not against it, companies are okay to be listed if one or the other is true (listing a source is prefered!)

Remote is meant to allow people from anywhere (or at least anywhere in a given timezone) without being forced to be in an office on a daily base.
